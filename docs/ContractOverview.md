# Smart Contracts Overview

There are currently three directories: Interfaces, Contracts and Guides.

Interfaces are usually for understanding the rough usage of the corresponding contracts, while contracts often provide more in-depth explanations.

In the Guides section, we'll be putting more tutorials to help facilitate the integration with our smart contracts!
